      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;internship-overview&#34;&gt;Internship Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7th August 2023 - 7th September 2023&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conducted Seaborn workshop for more than 12 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of Review and Test team for newly created coding courses on C#, Python and Data Science for children and teens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching Python with Blockly, Electronics and MIT App Inventor to children ages 5 - 13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gained knowledge in basic C# programming, basic JavaScript programming, and several Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experiences-at-kidocode&#34;&gt;My Experiences at Kidocode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently interning at Kidocode, a technology and entrepreneurship school dedicated to nurturing young children and teenagers into future leaders. The company was established in 2014, and now has over 6,800 students.
&lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
During my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute my skills and passion to the Mathematics and Data Science Department, where I worked as a teacher assistant for a month.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
One of the highlights of my internship was being an integral part of the Review and Test team for Kidocode&amp;rsquo;s coding courses. I played a role in accelerating the course development process and ensuring the quality of content before its release to students. My involvement encompassed courses spanning diverse programming languages including C#, Python (Turtle), and Data Science. My contributions enriched my understanding of the curriculum development process and provide valuable insights that contributed to the courses&amp;rsquo; readiness for student engagement.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Among my achievements, I conducted a Data Science workshop on Seaborn, a Python visualization library, catering to an audience of 12 participants. This experience enhanced my public speaking and presentation skills.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
I dedicated myself to continuous learning and skill development. I delved into the realm of basic JavaScript and C#, Electronics, and learned MIT App Inventor for mobile app development. Additionally, I honed my proficiency in essential Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, equipping me with versatile tools for data analysis and visualization.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Beyond the technical aspects, my internship at Kidocode enriched my soft skills as well. The demands of multitasking between diverse responsibilities such as student instruction, composing student reports, and testing courses enhanced my time management abilities. As I interacted with fellow team members and students, I further developed strong communication skills that were vital in conducting workshops and providing constructive feedback during testing phases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
